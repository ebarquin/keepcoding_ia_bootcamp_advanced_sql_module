# üìñ Advanced SQL Practice - Bootcamp IA

This repository contains the solution for the Advanced SQL practice as part of the Artificial Intelligence Bootcamp. Various SQL scripts have been developed in PostgreSQL and BigQuery for data modeling, database creation, and data processing.

## üìå Project Description

The goal of this practice is to implement a data model for managing calls in an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system. Several SQL queries are developed to generate key indicators and cleaning functions.

## üîß Prerequisites

To run the scripts, you need:

- PostgreSQL installed on your system or using a cloud instance (e.g., Tembo.io).
- Access to Google BigQuery with a sandbox environment enabled.
- A compatible SQL execution environment (e.g., TablePlus, DBeaver, VS Code).

## üìö Module Topics

In this module, we have worked with **PostgreSQL** and **BigQuery**, exploring different advanced SQL techniques for data processing and analysis. Topics covered include:

### üîπ Databases and Modeling

- Definition and organization of relational databases.
- Creation of entity-relationship diagrams (ERD).
- Normalization and normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).
- Referential integrity and primary/foreign keys.

### üîπ SQL Language and Its Components

- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: CREATE, ALTER, DROP.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- **DQL (Data Query Language)**: SELECT, JOINs, subqueries, aggregate functions.
- **DCL (Data Control Language)**: GRANT, REVOKE.

### üîπ BigQuery

- Introduction to BigQuery and its working environment.
- Creation and management of datasets and tables.
- Advanced queries in BigQuery.

### üîπ Data Warehousing and ETL

- Concept of Data Warehouse, Data Lake, and Data Mart.
- Differences between OLTP and OLAP.
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT processes.

### üîπ Advanced SQL

- **Best practices in SQL**: aliases, indentation, modularization with CTEs.
- **Conditional expressions**: CASE WHEN, COALESCE.
- **Aggregate functions**: COUNT, SUM, AVG, STRING_AGG.
- **Queries with subqueries and CTEs (Common Table Expressions).**
- **Use of triggers and stored functions in PostgreSQL.**
